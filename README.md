Traytree - A system tray directories link utility
-------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION

    Traytree is a simple utility for quick access to a set of configured
    disk folders using a system tray popup menu.

    Traytree configuration uses a text file called Traytree.ini saved in
    the same path of executable. The configuration file contains a set of
    text lines formatted as follow:

        folder_alias_name_1 = folder_path_1
        folder_alias_name_2 = folder_path_2
        <separator>
        .......
        folder_alias_name_n = folder_path_n
        .......

    where:

        folder_alias_name    is the alias of the folder as it is shown
                             in the popup menu
        folder_path          is the absolute path of the folder
        <separator>          show a menu line separator between menuitems
                             in the popup menu
